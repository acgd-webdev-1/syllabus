    before: |
      Before we get started, create some files and get ready.

      1. Create a folder named `image-card`
      2. Make an `index.html`
      3. Make a `main.css` in your `css` folder.

          The crazy `calc()` is just really to make the text align properly when it also has a border.

          The `calc()` value allows us to get the browser to calculate between two different units.

      With a refresh what you should see is this:

      Notice how the title is now at the bottom of the screen, that’s because the coordinates for `absolute` default to position against `<body>`

  - title: "Fix card title position"
    before: |
      To fix the positioning of the `.card-title` we need to find a parent element that we can set `position: relative`

      Using `relative` will reset the coordinates so the `bottom` and `left` position against the parent container instead.

      *Luckily, it’s inside the `<header class="card-head">` tag. So let’s target that!*
    code_lang: "css"
    code_file: "css/main.css"
    code: |
      ⋮

      .card-head {
        position: relative;
      }
    lines:
      - num: 4
        text: "Using `position: relative` on this element will reset the coordinate system for all `absolute` children."
    after: |
      Now the `.card-title` snaps right into place.

      ![](stage-3.jpg)

  - title: "Position the card label"
    before: |
      Since the `.card-head` is already `relative` all we need to do is just put `absolute` and coordinates onto `.card-label`

      Because it’s parent container is `relative` it will automatically position itself against that box.
    code_lang: "css"
    code_file: "css/main.css"
    code: |
      .card-label {
        ⋮
        position: absolute;
        left: 0;
        top: 0;
      }
